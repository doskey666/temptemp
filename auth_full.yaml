    summary: Get a new bearer authentication token.
    description: >
      You need to authenticate your call in each API endpoint. The
      authentication is done using

      an authorization token you need to send in the headers of your HTTP call
      (i.e. "Authorization: Bearer {token}").

      When you sign up for using this API you receive a username and a
      password. You need to use this endpoint with the

      username:password combination to retrieve a new bearer token.
